# Dutch Cities
An example to visualize/animate Mesa models on a continuous canvas with Earth coordinates. 

## How to Run
* Launch the visualization
```
    $ python model_viz.py
```

## Files

* [model.py](model.py): Contains the model `DutchCitiesModel` and the `CityAgent` class. During the model generation, the given bounds of the latitude and longitude in Decimal Degrees (DD) are translated into the bounds of the HTML5 canvas. 
  
* [SimpleContinuousModule.py](SimpleContinuousModule.py): Defines ``SimpleCanvas``, the Python side of a custom visualization module for drawing objects with continuous positions. This is an adaptation of the Flocker example provided by the Mesa project. 
  
* [simple_continuous_canvas.js](simple_continuous_canvas.js): JavaScript side of the ``SimpleCanvas`` visualization module; takes the output generated by the Python ``SimpleCanvas`` element and draws it in the browser window via HTML5 canvas. This is an adaptation of the Flocker example provided by the Mesa project.
  
* [model_viz.py](model_viz.py): Sets up the visualization; uses the SimpleCanvas element defined above. Run the server.
  
* [DutchCities.csv](DutchCities.csv): The data of Dutch cities (population, lat, lon) used to generate city agents. 
  
* [DutchCities.ipynb](DutchCities.ipynb): Tests the model in a Jupyter notebook.
